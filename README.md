# Solidity Contract Lesson

![Etherum](https://github.com/DevonMartens/SolidityContractLesson/blob/main/Photo/etherum.jpg?raw=true)

This a lesson on writing a smart contract in Solidity. In order to understand smart contracts, you first need to know what the Ethereum blockchain is and how it works. It does not have a centralized source like a cloud platform such as Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services would. Developers run Ethereum on their machines and are paid in cryptocurrencies called ether. A cryptocurrency is essentially a digital asset. The ledger that tracks these assets is the Ethereum blockchain (there are other types of blockchain that also serve as ledgers for cryptocurrencies). The Ethereum blockchain is the database that tracks what is owed, stored, and runs smart contracts.

Developers who run the Ethereum blockchain on their machine for ether are called miners. Gas is the cost necessary to perform transactions on the network based on the amount of memory your contract uses. Miners who use their computer to run the Ethereum Blockchain (virual machine) set these costs based on supply and demand. The network that all these computers are running on to mine is the Ethereum virtual machine. That is the network that the Ethereum Blockchain runs on. It is in your best interest to ensure that your program uses the least amount of memory and data to save money, or gas.

A contract that runs on the Ethereum blockchain automatically executes when all the conditions are met. Since, digital assets can be transfer and contracts can be written this is valueable because it eliminates the need for a lawyer to write a contract and a bank to transfer money.

# This Lesson is on Writing Contracts in Solidity

In the Solution Folder there is a written smart contract and a step by step guid to writing it and it is doing. 

If you want to try it on your own first there is a starter code file and instructions in the starter code on what to do. 

In the lesson folder there is a guide to writing in solidity which talks about syntax, the Ethereum blockchain is better explained there as well, and the solution at the end of the lesson is explained.

# Key take aways from this Lesson:

1.	Why blockchain developers are so valuable
2.	Ethereum blockchain fundamentals
   	How the Network works
 	Mining and what it is
	Gas
    Ether
3.	Smart Contracts and how they work!
4.	Solidity fundamentals including:
  	Declare the version of Solidity for the compiler to use with pragma.
   	Create a contract.
   	Events (declare and emit)
   	Functions
   	Variables
   	Returns
   	If/else statements
   	For loops
   	Mapping
5.	The remix IDE

# The next lesson will be about:
In our next lesson we will learn how to deploy contracts and create and use real addresses for contracts on the Ethereum network.
